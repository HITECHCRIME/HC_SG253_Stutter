## Lyrics

```
blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'

you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking you can do better innit

let me lay it out 
let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud

trippy mind, endless cost's what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight met the ground (melts)
till we killin', till we killin'

blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'
you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking it can do better innit (in it)

let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud
trippy mind, endless cost for what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight melts the ground (met the ground)
till we killin', till we killin'
