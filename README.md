## Lyrics

```
blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'

you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking it can do better innit (in it)

let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud
trippy mind, endless cost for what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight melts the ground
till we killing

```
