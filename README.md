## Lyrics

```
blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'

you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking you can do better innit

let me lay it out 
let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud

trippy mind, endless cost's what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight met the ground (melts)
till we killin', till we killin'

blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'
you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking it can do better innit (in it)

let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud
trippy mind, endless cost for what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight melts the ground (met the ground)
till we killin', till we killin'

## Lore Notes

- 0:01-0:05 / during the beginning the teal color lasery dots instead of eyes start dimmly glowing (they disappear as I move the head downwards and it lights a bit the clothing)
- 0:15 / backround flashes with the teal color of the lasery eye dots, just for a moment as they boot up
