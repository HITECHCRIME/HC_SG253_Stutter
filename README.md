## Lyrics

```
blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'

you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking you can do better innit

let me lay it out 
let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud

trippy mind, endless cost's what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight met the ground (melts)
till we killin', till we killin'

blaaargh
is this what you truly want
hiss - from the mouth
venom spits, death for the livin'
you want out missy
i can tell you breath in
poisonous clouds from the self
thinking it can do better innit (in it)

let me lay it out 
i've been gone for a while
let me lay it out
tying knots for the proud
trippy mind, endless cost for what I'm giving
your eyesight, foresight melts the ground (met the ground)
till we killin', till we killin'

```

## Lore Notes


## Music Video


## Music Video Preview

- FIRST OF ALL VISUALLY CUT THE CORNERS IN TRAPESIUM SHAPE DIAGONAL, THIS LOOKS QUITE INTERESTING WITH BLACK TECHIE CORNERS
- ADD QR CODE FLASH AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END
- MAKE A QR CODE 15 SEC STORY

VISUAL TRACKING

- 0:01-0:05 / during the beginning the teal color lasery dots instead of eyes start dimmly glowing (they disappear as I move the head downwards and it lights a bit the clothing)
- 0:15 / background flashes with the teal color of the lasery eye dots, just for a moment as they boot up
- 0:21 / moving towards the wall in the back the wall flickers for a moment with reflected glow of the laser eyes booting up
- 0:25 / the laser eyes boot up finally and they stay on the face (tracking - visual)
- 0:29 / the lasers are now fully booted and the glow with a piercing light as i look into the camera and then look up at the end of that clip, as i have my head down on the punch down the laser glow flickers as it releases more photons due to emotion
- 0:39 / as i look to the right, the right side of the wall and side placement of the screen is lit up with a flicker of the teal
- 0:43 / as slowmo enters the glow from the laser point eyes lights up slowly as i look back and turn
